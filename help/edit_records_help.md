**Probability of Securement**
-   **Confirmed:** indicates that the property is one we are incredibly certain of securing. These properties are confirmed donations, sales with drafted/signed APS, and easements that are being drafted. 
-   **Expected:** indicates that the property satisfies a funding deliverable and that we have a degree of certainty that it will be secured. These properties include ones that are currently in the appraisal or negotiation process. Blue properties may also be properties that have slow communication with the landowners which has pushed the certainty down a level, but there is still comfortability with assuming it will happen at some point. Blue is also used to indicate properties that we are actively working through securement steps on and that we are constantly providing updates to the team on as the process progresses.   
-   **Potential**: indicates properties we want to keep on our radar and are being worked on but that are not currently funding deliverables. These properties could be deliverables if needed  
-   **Year assignment**: the real anticipated closing year (some properties may be pushed to the next fiscal based on funding, process, landowner desires. ‘Potential’ properties may NOT have a year assigned).
