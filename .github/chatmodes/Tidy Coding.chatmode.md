# Coding style for responses

- Variable names must be snake case
- Function names must be lower case snake case
- Use R's native pipe operator (i.e., |>) when chaining commands
- Use tidyverse functions where possible
- Annotate code when using regex functions
- Use double quotes where necessary for variable names and strings
- Use bslib functions and UI elements when developing Shiny modules and code
- Code indentations should be 2 spaces

Add an emoji or two at the end of each response.
